                <h1 class="sub-heading">Real Life and Digital Life, in balance and harmony.</h1>

                <p>I am someone who values balance, and this applies with both digital and real life activities. As much as my skills and interests revolve around that of creating websites or applications for the web, I also value having to explore beyond what our computer and the internet could offer (there is a lot).</p>

                <p>My passion is then making sure that our daily lives, which uses both digital and real life, become more seamless and smooth for people, and therefore, improve their lives through such applications. My goal, also aligning to this, is to provide professional, yet easy to use applications for the people, bridging the gap and untangling the complexities of the web.</p>

                <p>My web development skills, again aligning to my passion, revolves around my capability of communicating complex topics and aspects of web development simple and easy to understand and use (which is a soft skill). I sometimes also provide unorthodox solutions that work to make development easier by applying alternative ways of making an application work. Lastly, which is the essential skill that full stack or any programmer should have, is to be able to tackle and solve problems when they arise, and being critical on the code that will then be use(d) for the web.</p>
